*Creating a means to separate AEM Back End Tech from Front End Development*

### About

This is currently a 1 to 1 file generator from HTL to HTML with only NodeJS

### Folder Structure

The structure expected is as follows

```bash
.
+-- components
|   +-- component-1 (put component htl, js and JSON together)
|   |   +-- component-1.htl 
|   |   +-- component-1.js
|   |   +-- component-1.json
|   +-- component-2 (put component htl, js and JSON together)
|   |   +-- component-2.htl 
|   |   +-- component-2.js
|   |   +-- component-2.json
+-- rawhtml (this is the full static html reference)
|   +-- html-1.spec.html
|   +-- html-2.spec.html
+-- specs (this is the JSON object logic of full html pages)
|   +-- html-1.js
|   +-- html-1.json
|   +-- html-2.js
|   +-- html-2.json
+-- templates (this is the HTL version of the full html page)
|   +-- html-1.htl
|   +-- html-2.htl
```

### Components / Partials

Component HTL template is as follows:

Sample JSON: components/component-1/component-1.js:

~~~~
const { retrieveJsonData } = require('../../../src/loadJsonData');

const jsonFilePath = "test/components/component-1/component-1.json";
const jsonApiUrl = null;

module.exports = new Promise(async (resolve) => {
  let jsonData = await retrieveJsonData(jsonFilePath, jsonApiUrl);
  resolve (jsonData);
});

~~~~

Sample HTL: components/component-1/component-1.htl:

~~~~
<template data-sly-template.component-1="${@ component-1}">
    <h1>${component-1.title}</h1>
    <p>${component-1.description}</p>
</template>
~~~~
  
### Component / Partials Loading

When there is a need to use components, use loadComponents to load all components within the components/ folder

Sample templates/html-1.htl:

~~~~
<div data-sly-use.lib="./test/components/component-1/component-1.htl" data-sly-call="${lib.component-1 @ component-1=component-1}"></div>
~~~~

Sample specs/html-1.js:

~~~~
const { extendJson, retrieveJsonData } = require('../../src/loadJsonData');
const loadComponents = require('../../src/loadComponents');

const jsonFilePath = "test/specs//html-1.json";
const jsonApiUrl = null;

module.exports = new Promise(async (resolve) => {
  let jsonData = await retrieveJsonData(jsonFilePath, jsonApiUrl);
  let allComponentData = await loadComponents();
  resolve (extendJson (allComponentData, jsonData));
});
~~~~

### To Start

Install packages with Yarn

```bash
yarn install
```

Set up folders required (or can manually create generated_html/ and jsoutput/)

```bash
yarn init-folders
```

### Express

Run Express in a separate terminal to be able to view the files in the browser

Debug mode

```bash
yarn serve-debug
```

Production mode

```bash
yarn serve
```

### Webpack Hot Reload

Sample Run to generate html versions

```bash
yarn watch
```

The HTML file will then be available on the local server, eg.

http://localhost:3000/simple.html

### Client Libs

Client libs are stored in the folder clientlib-src/

The current script will now include the clientlibs into each component by running 
```bash
yarn clientlibs
```

Settings for this script are to be modified via clientlib.config.js

Note that the clientlibs are installed into the format of AEM but are not linked into the HTL

This is because the client libs requires this file which seems to be a file generated by AEM directly.
/libs/granite/sightly/templates/clientlib.html

Once set up, this should be the way to include the items to proceed further
